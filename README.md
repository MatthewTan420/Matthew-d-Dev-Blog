Design Process
This website is a portfolio of a student taking an engineering course and they wish to show their interviewers their talents and skills to get into future jobs and internships.

For a portfolio website, I want it to be simple and easy to navigate, it also showcases some of the user's achievements and projects that would catch the employer's attention. For a HTML website, it's a good way to impress the employers that the user has some coding skills

As an employer, I would want to navigate the website easily
As an employer, I would want to see the highlights of the portfolio
As an employer, I would want to contact the person for queries
